# Instacart Reorder Prediction Model 🛒🤖

A machine learning model that predicts which grocery products a user is likely to reorder based on their purchase history. Built with the Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset.

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 77% 
- **Precision (No Reorder)**: 96%
- **Recall (Reorder)**: 71%
- **F1-Score**: 0.81 weighted average

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Kaggle account (for dataset access)
- Kaggle API key

### Installation

1. **Install required packages:**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn kagglehub joblib
````

2. **Get your Kaggle API key:**

   * Go to [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)
   * Click your profile → Settings → API → Create New API Token
   * Place `kaggle.json` in your project folder or `~/.kaggle/`

3. **Run the model:**

```bash
python instacart_reorder_model.py
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Data Features Used:

* **User Behavior**: Order frequency, reorder patterns, shopping intervals
* **Product Popularity**: How often products are reordered by all users
* **User-Product Relationship**: How often specific users buy specific products

### Top Predictive Features:

1. **up\_orders** - Times user bought this product (36% importance)
2. **user\_orders** - User's total order count (11% importance)
3. **prod\_reorder\_probability** - Product's general reorder rate (10% importance)

### Model Architecture:

* **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
* **Samples**: 5,000 users (for demonstration)
* **Preprocessing**: Automatic handling of missing values and outliers
* **Scaling**: StandardScaler for feature normalization

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Predict Reorders for a User:

```python
# Predict top 10 products for user #1
top_reorders = predict_reorders(user_id=1, top_n=10)
print(top_reorders)
```

### Example Output:

```
   product_id  reorder_probability
0         196             0.921235
1       12427             0.895779
2       25133             0.884499
...       ...                  ...
```

### Load and Use Saved Model:

```python
from prediction_utils import load_and_predict

# Load model and make predictions
predictions = load_and_predict(user_id=2, top_n=5)
```

## 📈 Results Interpretation

### Model Strengths:

* ✅ 96% accurate at predicting products users **won't** reorder
* ✅ 71% recall for actual reorders
* ✅ Identifies clear patterns in user shopping behavior

### Areas for Improvement:

* ⚡ 26% precision for reorder predictions (some false positives)
* ⚡ Could benefit from more user data and feature engineering

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjust Model Parameters:

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=50,      # Increase for better performance
    max_depth=15,         # Adjust tree depth
    class_weight='balanced' # Handle imbalanced data
)
```

### Use More Data:

```python
# Increase sample size for better accuracy
sample_users = train.user_id.unique()[:20000]  # 20k users instead of 5k
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Dependencies:

* `pandas`, `numpy` - Data manipulation
* `scikit-learn` - Machine learning
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn` - Visualization
* `kagglehub` - Dataset access
* `joblib` - Model persistence

### Dataset:

* **Source**: [Instacart Market Basket Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis)
* **Size**: 3+ million grocery orders
* **Features**: User history, product information, order details

## 📋 Future Enhancements

* [ ] Add more sophisticated feature engineering
* [ ] Experiment with Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
* [ ] Implement hyperparameter tuning
* [ ] Add real-time prediction API
* [ ] Create web interface for demonstrations

## ⚠️ Notes

* The dataset is automatically downloaded via Kaggle API
* API keys are handled securely through environment variables
* First run may take several minutes to download and process data
* Model performance improves with more user data
