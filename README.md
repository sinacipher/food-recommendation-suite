# Instacart Reorder Prediction Model 🛒🤖

A machine learning model that predicts which grocery products a user is likely to reorder based on their purchase history. Built with the Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset.

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 77% 
- **Precision (No Reorder)**: 96%
- **Recall (Reorder)**: 71%
- **F1-Score**: 0.81 weighted average

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Kaggle account (for dataset access)
- Kaggle API key

### Installation

1. **Install required packages:**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn kagglehub joblib
```

2. **Get your Kaggle API key:**
   - Go to [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)
   - Click your profile → Settings → API → Create New API Token
   - Place `kaggle.json` in your project folder or `~/.kaggle/`

3. **Run the model:**
```bash
python instacart_reorder_model.py
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Data Features Used:
- **User Behavior**: Order frequency, reorder patterns, shopping intervals
- **Product Popularity**: How often products are reordered by all users
- **User-Product Relationship**: How often specific users buy specific products

### Top Predictive Features:
1. `up_orders` - Times user bought this product (36% importance)
2. `user_orders` - User's total order count (11% importance) 
3. `prod_reorder_probability` - Product's general reorder rate (10% importance)

### Model Architecture:
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Samples**: 5,000 users (for demonstration)
- **Preprocessing**: Automatic handling of missing values and outliers
- **Scaling**: StandardScaler for feature normalization

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Predict Reorders for a User:
```python
# Predict top 10 products user #1 will reorder
top_reorders = predict_reorders(user_id=1, top_n=10)
print(top_reorders)
```

### Output:
```
   product_id  reorder_probability
0         196             0.921235
1       12427             0.895779
2       25133             0.884499
...       ...                  ...
```

### Load and Use Saved Model:
```python
from prediction_utils import load_and_predict

# Load model and make predictions
predictions = load_and_predict(user_id=2, top_n=5)
```

## 📈 Results Interpretation

### Model Strengths:
- ✅ 96% accurate at predicting products users **won't** reorder
- ✅ 71% recall for actual reorders (good at not missing them)
- ✅ Identifies clear patterns in user shopping behavior

### Areas for Improvement:
- ⚡ 26% precision for reorder predictions (some false positives)
- ⚡ Could benefit from more user data and feature engineering

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjust Model Parameters:
```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=50,      # Increase for better performance
    max_depth=15,         # Adjust tree depth
    class_weight='balanced' # Handle imbalanced data
)
```

### Use More Data:
```python
# Increase sample size for better accuracy
sample_users = train.user_id.unique()[:20000]  # 20k users instead of 5k
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Dependencies:
- `pandas`, `numpy` - Data manipulation
- `scikit-learn` - Machine learning
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` - Visualization
- `kagglehub` - Dataset access
- `joblib` - Model persistence

### Dataset:
- **Source**: [Instacart Market Basket Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis)
- **Size**: 3+ million grocery orders
- **Features**: User history, product information, order details

## 📋 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add more sophisticated feature engineering
